Hey, I am Svyat. Slava is also correct.

Mainly I enjoy working on core infrastructure for anything meaningful, whether it's by my own hands or via managing people. My main belief is that software should be fast and as simple as possible.

In recent years, I've spent my time on the following:
- 2022-present: Engineer in Google Cloud Networking
- 2018-2022: Team Lead and Technical Program Manager at Yandex's internal microservice framework team
- Summer 2018: Software Engineering Intern at Google Shopping
- 2016-2018: Software Engineer at Yandex Ads infrastructure
- 2019, 2020, 2021: Instructor at Higher School of Economics, participating in several courses such as C++, Advanced Algorithms, and Introduction to Programming.
- 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016: Lecturer in Algorithms and Data Structures at the [Summer Informatics School in Russia](https://lksh.ru/)
